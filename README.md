## About the Project

This is a personal portfolio built with React. It has an about me section where you can find links to my LinkinedIn, Github, email and resume. There is a portfolio section displaying some of my best works and projects. Along with that you can find a contact form on the contact page. The portfolio section is created by a single card component. An array of my information about my best works is mapped through to create a single card component to be displayed for each project.
